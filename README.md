# helpschool contains the source code for http://helpschool.org

This site aims to connect donors directly to schools in need of material donations.
Teachers put the request with a product link to e-commerce site
Donors fill in those requets by buying and sending them directly to schools
We avoid any NGO's and their operating expenses in the process!.

Backend is written in 'golang', database is postgres and 
UI is written in React 

We expect this open-source project to grow into a non-profit organization connecting donors to schools directly.
